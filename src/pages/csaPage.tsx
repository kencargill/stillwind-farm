                <p className="row">Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) shares are a common way for local 
                    farmers & veggie consumers to partner. By investing in a full or half 
                    share throughout the winter months, we are able to plan & pay for the 
                    seeds, tools, & soil amendments necessary for a successful season. In 
                    return we commit to sharing the harvest with you for 18 weeks throughout 
                    the harvest season (June 7 - October 4)!</p>

                <p className="row">CSA shares differ from farmers market shopping in that each week we cater 
                    a bundle for you based on what is growing well in the field. In August this could look like:</p>
                <ul className="row">
                <li>3 pounds of heirloom tomatoes</li>
                <li>3 italian sweet peppers</li>
                <li>1 eggplant</li>
                <li>2 summer squash / zucchini</li>
                <li>1 bunch of scallions</li>
                <li>1 cucumber</li>
                <li>1 bag lettuce mix</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="row">Each week & month looks different, connecting us all to the ebbs 
                    & flows of seasonal growing. Alongside a convenient pick-up we 
                    also send members a weekly newsletter full of farm happenings, 
                    photos, recipes, & CSA member events.</p>
