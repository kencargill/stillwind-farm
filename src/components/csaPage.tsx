        <h3>CSA Overview</h3>
        <p>Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) shares are a common way for local 
            farmers & veggie consumers to partner. By investing in a full or half 
            share throughout the winter months, we are able to plan & pay for the 
            seeds, tools, & soil amendments necessary for a successful season. In 
            return we commit to sharing the harvest with you for 18 weeks throughout 
            the harvest season (June 7 - October 4)!</p>

        <p>CSA shares differ from farmers market shopping in that each week we cater 
            a bundle for you based on what is growing well in the field. In August this could look like:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>3 pounds of heirloom tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 italian sweet peppers</li>
        <li>1 eggplant</li>
        <li>2 summer squash / zucchini</li>
        <li>1 bunch of scallions</li>
        <li>1 cucumber</li>
        <li>1 bag lettuce mix</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each week & month looks different, connecting us all to the ebbs 
            & flows of seasonal growing. Alongside a convenient pick-up we 
            also send members a weekly newsletter full of farm happenings, 
            photos, recipes, & CSA member events.</p>

        <h3>Sign up / payment information:</h3>
        <p>We have designed our CSA to have two size options when signing 
            up, full or half. The size of your shares at pickup will be 
            indistinguishable, however, the frequency of your pick-ups will differ.</p>

            at Fulton St Farmers Market on Wednesdays between 4 - 6:30pm 
            OR on-farm (Belding) Tuesdays between 4:30 - 6pm. The cost of 
            this share is $630, assuming that each week we will provide 
            you with at least $35 worth of produce. </p>

        <p>If you sign up for a Half CSA share you will pick up every 
            other week at Fulton St Farmers Market on Wednesdays between
